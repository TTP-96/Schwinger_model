# Schwinger_model
A collection of codes to simulate the Schwinger model.

There are 3 approaches implemented here:
1. Exact Diagonalization (ED)
2. Tensor Network States (TNS) using the TeNPy library ( see TNS directory )
3. Neural Quantum States (NQS) using the NetKet library (see NQS directory )

Examples of how to run each approach and carry out comparisons are provided in their respective files.
